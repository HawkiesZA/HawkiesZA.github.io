When I started dancing, I figured it would be something fun to do for a little while. I’d meet some people, make some friends, and probably move on after a short time. I’m about 3 years in now and after this year I know that’s not the case anymore.


This year, while on a work trip in Ghana, I met up with some of the local dancers there one night and danced in my first foreign country.


Later on in the year, I went on my first personal overseas trip which also happened to be my first foreign congress (Croatia Summer Sensual Days & Summer Salsa Festival). If not for the dance community and the friends I’ve made through dancing, I probably never would have taken this trip. It would have been a shame, because I can honestly say that this was one of the best experiences I’ve had.


People who have been dancing for a while tell those stories of dancers they met overseas who they had an amazing dance connection with even though neither spoke the same language. You smile as you listen, and think “Nah, that’s a one-in-a-million experience”. It happens a lot more than you think. The trick is that you have to put yourself in the right space where you can allow someone else in. It’s hard, but it gets easier with time. However, it’s like a drug - once you’ve felt it you want it again and you will go to great lengths (and endure long flights) to feel it. *It’s magical.*


After the Croatian festivals I came back home, smiling for weeks because of the magic I had experienced. I was now solidly addicted to this drug of dance. I poured in time, money, and effort to gain more knowledge and to get better. I was part of two performance teams, I started learning to DJ, and I started taking my dance photography more seriously.


Which brings us to the [Cape Town Salsa Congress](/gallery/mzansi-ctsf-2016/) that has just passed.


I performed twice on one night. The first performance we’d been practicing for close to nine months. The second we’d been practicing for maybe six months and there was a part with a separate dance group that we hadn’t even seen yet before performance night. It was intense, scary, and exhilarating all at the same time.


I took a lot of photos this congress. Some were posed, most were action shots. I used techniques I’ve been practicing for a while, and I tried some new tricks.


Horror befel me on the Friday night when my 50mm f/1.4 lens stopped focusing (apparently a known design flaw). I recounted my story many times that night - I had no idea what I was going to do. Then I told someone my story and they said “Oh, I have a 15mm fisheye lens that you can borrow if you want”. I was floored. I didn’t know this person and they didn’t know me, but somehow they trusted me enough to just hand me an expensive lens for 3 days. There is true magic in the dance community.


I didn’t have boat loads of dances. I certainly wasn’t dancing nearly as much as I had at the Croatian congresses. However, it’s not the quantity that matters, but the quality. On the first night of the festival I felt the magic again, and I ended the congress feeling the magic. I went to bed exhausted - I still am almost a week later. But I went to bed happy.


I had good performances with great teams. I took some of the best photos I’ve taken so far. And I had magical dances.
