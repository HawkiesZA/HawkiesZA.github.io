I got my first camera when I was a little kid.

If memory serves, it was a Christmas or birthday gift - a little film point and shoot. I took it with me on family vacations and school outings. I took photos around the house.

I still have some of the photos I took with it, but most of the prints and the negatives are lost to me, because little me didn't have good archival skills and didn't recognise the photos for the great memories that they were.

I can't remember exactly why - either the camera stopped working, or it became too expensive to maintain due to the rising cost of batteries, film, and film development - but I stopped using that camera. Only after many years, when I started earning a real salary, did I buy a camera again. My first DSLR was a Nikon D3100.

*This time I found a love for photography I didn't realise I had lost until then.*

My photos were for me, and so they were of things I found interesting and beautiful. Flowers, landscapes, nature. Trying to take portraits, posing people, was incredibly hard for me. It still is, to some extent.

When my mother's house was burgled, the burglars took my laptop, camera, and tablet. I was most upset by them taking my camera. Sure, my laptop had all my data, but it was encrypted and password protected, and I had decent cloud backups. My camera, however, was my most personal item, and that 85mm lens I bought made such amazing photos!

Still, I had to move on. Insurance paid out, and I was able to get a shiny new D3200, an unexpected upgrade. My love could continue.

I've moved on from the D3200 (a discussion for a later time), and my subjects have changed, and so I find myself where I am now: trying to tell the complex story of the dancer - a person who expresses emotion through movement to music.

Welcome to the beginning of this story.
