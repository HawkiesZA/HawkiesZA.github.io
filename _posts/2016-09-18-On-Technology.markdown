When I started feeling the itch to travel I also came to the realisation that lugging around a big 'ol DSLR wouldn't be the most comfortable thing in the world. I had already started second-guessing taking it on long hikes. I needed something smaller and lighter.

I traded in my faithful D3200, and ~~went to the dark side~~. I got a Canon M3 because 
1. Sony had pulled their camera range from South Africa
2. Nikon had no mirrorless option
3. Canon was significantly cheaper than Fujifilm, and reviews seemed to indicate that their competing products were largely similar in quality
