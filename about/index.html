<p>I'm Gerrit Vermeulen, a software developer, photographer, and dancer from Cape Town. Most of my day is spent building products to help make people's lives a little bit better. The rest of my time I'm trying to tell a story. Sometimes it is my story, and that's when you'll find me on the dance floor to the sounds of Salsa, Kizomba, and Bachata. Other times I am behind the camera trying to tell the story of dancers, their lives, and their love of the music and dance.</p>
<p>Here you'll find some examples of my photography, and some thoughts of my craft.</p>
